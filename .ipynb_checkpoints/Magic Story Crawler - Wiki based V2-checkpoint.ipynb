       " <p>When Odric last looked out the window, it had been early afternoon. Now a cold mist had settled on Thraben, and the city was cloaked in evening shadows. <i>Where is the moon?</i> Odric's arm jerked involuntarily, nearly upending his ink jar. <i>No</i>, he reminded himself. <i>It no longer matters</i>. The phases of the moon were no longer predictors of life and death now that Avacyn had returned and cleansed the world. <i>Or at least begun to...</i></p>\n",
       " <p>He glanced across the oak table at Grete, his lieutenant, who looked surprised by his sudden movement. Sir Odric, Master Tactician, Commander of the Gavony Riders and Recipient of the Moonsilver Accommodation didn't startle easily.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"Sir?\" Grete asked.</p>\n",

       " <p>\"There's still no sign of Ludevic,\" Grete continued, scanning the parchment. \"A miller spotted him near Estwald, but he'd moved on before the cathars could detain him. So the hunt continues.\"</p>\n",
       " <p>Just the thought of the mad alchemist made his head ache. Odric leaned back and pressed his palms against his temples. This was a temporary assignment—one he had requested in hopes of getting an angel's-eye view of Innistrad. Every regiment sent in daily dispatches of what they encountered in the field. From these reports, Odric was piecing together where the Church's power was still being threatened. But he didn't enjoy sitting in a leather chair in a cathedral chamber. He was a battlefield man, much better suited to combat maneuvers than negotiating the politics of the Avacynian Church.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"What of your friends around Hanweir?\" Odric asked and was rewarded with a slight smile from the deadly serious Grete. She'd led an assault against a legion of ghouls ravaging the moorlands, a success that had earned her the promotion to second in command.</p>\n",

       " <p>Grete nodded and scanned the last dispatch. Only a few more days, and Odric's administrative duties in Thraben would be done. His time here had been valuable. He knew that demons were still on the loose, but Avacyn herself was focused on the <a class=\"autocard-link\" data-image-url=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;name=Helvault\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault\">Helvault</a> escapees. Necromantic activity still plagued the moorlands, but nothing like the heyday of Gisa and Geralf's tyranny. Sigarda's forces were hunting the perpetrators of the Nephalia Massacre. The vampires had all but slunk back to Stensia. <i>Someday soon, I will purge that province myself, but first I must be sure that Avacyn's blessings hold.</i></p>\n",

       " <p>\"It says he fell fleeing a... werewolf. He later died of a fever and gangrene.\"</p>\n",
       " <p>As Odric pushed himself to his feet, it felt as if a steel trap had closed around his stomach. Every morning since the Cursemute had rid the land of the lycanthrope curse, he'd fallen to his knees praising Avacyn's blessing. But in his heart, he doubted. What if the wolfir reverted to a murderous state? What if the abominations that had slaughtered so many of his kin returned?</p>\n",

       " <p>The Mayor of Torbach was a pompous, red-faced administrator who took power after Avacyn returned. <i>A sheep in fancy clothes, </i>Odric thought.<i> Not a leader during the darkest hours.</i> The mayor had been ranting at them since they arrived in his chamber. Grete shifted uncomfortably beside Odric, no doubt wondering why he was letting this tirade go on so long.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"I demand to know! What is this new devilry? Werewolves walk even during the half moon? Did you not promise that this curse was lifted from us? These wolfir may slaughter us even during the daylight?\"</p>\n",
       " <p>\"Sir, there is no reason to believe that a wolfir—\" Odric said.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"It slaughtered the widow of Bitterheart Hill!\" the mayor interrupted. \"Destroyed her cottage just last night! And took its time under her roof. Maybe it slumbered a bit? Going to cook a hock of meat in her fireplace?\"</p>\n",
       " <p>\"The creature was in her cottage?\" Odric asked.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"This vile creature is terrorizing my village. Where are the angels? The cathars waste time building bridges and trimming apple trees and...\"</p>\n",
       " <p>\"One more question,\" Odric interrupted. \"Has it attacked other cottages? Or just the widow's?\"</p>\n",
       " <p>\"Cottages, no. But my son! He was just a boy....\"</p>\n",
       " <p>Odric laid his hand on the mayor's shoulder. At his touch, the man abruptly stopped speaking, and tears brimmed in his brown eyes.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"We will find the monster that killed your son and put its head on a pike,\" Odric assured the mayor, who had lost his bluster and seemed to have no more words for them. Odric and Grete found their own way back to the street where their horses waited.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"He acted as if all it was our fault,\" Grete said angrily.</p>\n",

Odric spent years watching the night sky, noting how the moon touched the world in unexpected ways. Some seemed trivial. The leaves of the maple curled downward during a full moon. Others were crucial to survival. Ghouls moved quicker during a new moon. A waxing moon brought unnatural fighting among the rank and file.

       " <p>The guttural voice infuriated Odric. Every corpse that had been mutilated by a werewolf flashed through his memory. He would never forget the raw carnage of the attacks and the senseless rage that left human bodies in bloody tatters. The only way Odric could comprehend those murders was if they were done by mindless beasts. Mindless beasts don't have language or a voice to speak it. And never a name. <i>Garruk Wildspeaker</i>. Even when Odric killed werewolves in human form, he never spoke their names. In his mind, the curse stripped them of any human identity they once possessed.</p>\n",
       " <p>Odric bashed the blunt end of his sword against the monster's temple, hearing the crack of skull as it shattered under the weight of his blow. It slumped to the ground. He yanked the net off the monster and grabbed a handful of its long matted hair. He yanked it back to expose the bare throat where lifeblood still pulsed through its unnatural veins.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"Wait!\" Grete was at his shoulder.</p>\n",

       " <p>\"I demand to know! What is this new devilry? Werewolves walk even during the half moon? Did you not promise that this curse was lifted from us? These wolfir may slaughter us even during the daylight?\"</p>\n",

Odric spent years watching the night sky, noting how the moon touched the world in unexpected ways. Some seemed trivial. The leaves of the maple curled downward during a full moon. Others were crucial to survival. Ghouls moved quicker during a new moon. A waxing moon brought unnatural fighting among the rank and file. With Avacyn's Cursemute, Odric secretly felt he had lost one of his tactical advantages. The moon was playing new games, and Odric had yet to learn the rules.</p>\n",

       " <p>The guttural voice infuriated Odric. Every corpse that had been mutilated by a werewolf flashed through his memory. He would never forget the raw carnage of the attacks and the senseless rage that left human bodies in bloody tatters. The only way Odric could comprehend those murders was if they were done by mindless beasts. Mindless beasts don't have language or a voice to speak it. And never a name. <i>Garruk Wildspeaker</i>. Even when Odric killed werewolves in human form, he never spoke their names. In his mind, the curse stripped them of any human identity they once possessed.</p>\n",
       " <p>Odric bashed the blunt end of his sword against the monster's temple, hearing the crack of skull as it shattered under the weight of his blow. It slumped to the ground. He yanked the net off the monster and grabbed a handful of its long matted hair. He yanked it back to expose the bare throat where lifeblood still pulsed through its unnatural veins.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"Wait!\" Grete was at his shoulder.</p>\n",
       " <p>Odric lifted his sword. <i>One blow to sunder the head from the body</i>.</p>\n",
       " <p>\"It's not a werewolf! Sir, Avacyn's blessings didn't fail us.\"</p>\n",

But unlike him, her conscience was untarnished. <i>She's still hopeful.</i> Grete's compassion would kill her someday. <i>Someday soon. </i>Odric let go of the monster and sheathed his sword.</p>\n",
